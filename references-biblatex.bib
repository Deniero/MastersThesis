	abstract = {Setting the control parameters of a genetic algorithm to obtain good results is a long-standing problem. We define an experiment design and analysis method to determine relative importance and effective settings for control parameters of any evolutionary algorithm, and we apply this method to a classic binary-encoded genetic algorithm ({GA}). Subsequently, as reported elsewhere, we applied the {GA}, with the control parameter settings determined here, to steer a population of cloud-computing simulators toward behaviors that reveal degraded performance and system collapse. {GA}-steered simulators could serve as a design tool, empowering system engineers to identify and mitigate low-probability, costly failure scenarios. In the existing {GA} literature, we uncovered conflicting opinions and evidence regarding key {GA} control parameters and effective settings to adopt. Consequently, we designed and executed an experiment to determine relative importance and effective settings for seven {GA} control parameters, when applied across a set of numerical optimization problems drawn from the literature. This paper describes our experiment design, analysis, and results. We found that crossover most significantly influenced {GA} success, followed by mutation rate and population size and then by rerandomization point and elite selection. Selection method and the precision used within the chromosome to represent numerical values had least influence. Our findings are robust over 60 numerical optimization problems.},

	abstract = {There is tremendous global enthusiasm for research, development, and deployment of autonomous vehicles ({AVs}), e.g., self-driving taxis and trucks from Waymo and Baidu. The current practice for testing {AVs} uses virtual tests-where {AVs} are tested in software simulations-since they offer a more efficient and safer alternative compared to field operational tests. Specifically, search-based approaches are used to find particularly critical situations. These approaches provide an opportunity to automatically generate tests; however, systematically creating valid and effective tests for {AV} software remains a major challenge. To address this challenge, we introduce {scenoRITA}, a test generation approach for {AVs} that uses evolutionary algorithms with (1) a novel gene representation that allows obstacles to be fully mutable, hence, resulting in more reported violations, (2) 5 test oracles to determine both safety and motion sickness-inducing violations, and (3) a novel technique to identify and eliminate duplicate tests. Our extensive evaluation shows that {scenoRITA} can produce effective driving scenarios that expose an ego car to safety critical situations. {scenoRITA} generated tests that resulted in a total of 1,026 unique violations, increasing the number of reported violations by 23.47\% and 24.21\% compared to random test generation and state-of-the-art partially-mutable test generation, respectively.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we outline an approach for automatically generating challenging road networks for virtual testing of an automated lane-keeping system. Based on a set of control points, we construct a parametric curve representing a road network, defining the dynamic driving task an automated lane-keeping system-equipped vehicle must perform. Changing control points has a global influence on the resulting road geometry. Our approach uses search to find control-point sets that result in a challenging road, eventually forcing the vehicle to leave the intended path. We apply our approach in different search variants to evaluate their performance regarding test efficiency and the diversity of failing tests. In addition, we evaluate different genetic algorithm control parameter configurations to investigate the most influential parameters and if specific configurations can be seen as optimal, leading to better results than others. For both studies, we consider another search-based test method and two different random test generators as a baseline for comparison. The empirical results indicate that specific control parameter settings increase the overall performance for each search variant. While the population size is the most influential control parameter for all methods, the performance improvement when using optimal settings is only significant for one method.},
