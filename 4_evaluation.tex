\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{chap:evaluation}
in this chapter, we evaluate and compare various different settings
In this chapter, we will incrementally move to an optimized Genetic Algorithm


\section{Hyperparameter tuning}
\subsection{Comparing Pop Size}
The mentioned performance limitations forced a lower population size for most simulations than optimal.

\subsection{Different Cost Function}
this will be more tricky to explain as everything is just interal functionality

\subsection{Crossover vs MutProp}
What is the best configuration?

\section{Behaviour Tree enabled}
Will the scenarios be more interesting if the ga is not allowed to have controll over the Ego Vehicle?

\section{Rules enabled}
