** LaTeX-KOMA-template

This is a generic template for [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX][LaTeX]] documents using [[http://www.komascript.de/][KOMA Script]] classes
which are pretty common at least in German spoken countries.

The template does *not* want to contain each and every trick but should
provide a *clean*, *consistent* and *well documented* starting point for any
document exceeding a few pages. So if you plan to write a longer report,
a diploma thesis, a PhD thesis, or similar, this template should give you
a good basis.

The focus is that you - the author - are able to concentrate on the *content*
of your work rather than start fiddling around with the look of the document.
Several typographic optimizations are included in order to get a final document
that is optimized to deliver your content.

Please do read [[https://github.com/novoid/LaTeX-KOMA-template/blob/master/Template-Documentation.pdf][Template-Documentation.pdf]].

*** Example Documents

In case you want to see some example documents generated via this
template, please do read [[https://github.com/novoid/LaTeX-KOMA-template/blob/master/Hall_of_fame.org][the Hall of Fame]].

Do me a favor and *do submit the name or an URL of your final document* as well. It helps
other people in their decision process and adds up to a very cool
collection of results we can be proud of.

*** Requirements

This template uses up-to-date technology like pdflatex, [[http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/info/translations/biblatex/de/][biblatex]]
(instead of BibTeX-Format), [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biber_(LaTeX)][biber]] (instead of bibtex-compiler), and
optionally [[http://www.gnu.org/s/make/][GNU make.]]  You should be familiar with compiling LaTeX
documents by yourself. If you are new to LaTeX please get basic
knowledge from tutorial pages such as [[http://LaTeX.TUGraz.at][this one]].

You can find out more in [[https://github.com/novoid/LaTeX-KOMA-template/blob/master/Template-Documentation.pdf][Template-Documentation.pdf]].

** What Makes This Template Special?

The speciality of this consistent template is, that every setting in
the preamble is *well documented* (in LaTeX). You can generate the
documentation file "Template-Documentation.pdf" on your own by not
removing the template documentation include command in the main LaTeX
file and using [[http://www.gnu.org/software/make/][GNU make]] with the rule "templatedocu":

#+begin_src sh
make templatedocu
#+end_src

This command results in the "[[https://github.com/novoid/LaTeX-KOMA-template/blob/master/Template-Documentation.pdf][Template-Documentation.pdf]]" file
containing the most current documentation of this template. Please
refer to this PDF file for further information about the template.

*** How to Start?

Please do read the "[[https://github.com/novoid/LaTeX-KOMA-template/blob/master/Template-Documentation.pdf][Template-Documentation.pdf]]" file which contains a
"How to use this LaTeX template" section.
