# Title 
Hello, my name is Sumann Daniel, and today, I will present you my master's thesis with the title method of hyperparameter optimization of a genetic algorithm applied in critical scenario generation for autonomous vehicles. This masterâ€™s thesis was done cooperation with AVL List.
# Introduction
This master's thesis proposes a method for critical graphics scenario generation. Which can be used to validate the safety of autonomous driving systems. 
It's implemented in a way that a vehicle, which is called the ego vehicle, has an autonomous driving functionality applied. 
The traffic scenarios are then generated by a genetic algorithm, which will optimize their criticality. And this is done by the genetic algorithm by controlling all the other vehicles and pedestrians which are called NPCs in the simulation. 
The genetic algorithm will use the cumulated emergency brake duration of the ego vehicle as the fitness function. So, this means that the algorithm will optimize for the duration of the emergency brakes of the ego vehicle.
# Research Questions
To the research questions:
First research question states, if a genetic algorithm is suitable for generating critical driving scenarios compared to random search? So basically, it asks, if a simpler algorithm is able to produce similar results.
The second research question is, if the performance of a genetic algorithm be improved by optimizing the control parameter using the Taguchi method? TODO add sentence
