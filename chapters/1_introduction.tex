\chapter{Introduction}
\todo{better and longer introduction}
This Thesis will use a genetic algorithm in order to generate critical driving scenarios for testing ADAS/AD functionality in vehicles.
While generating these scenarios is the objective, the main task of the thesis will evolve around the implementation of the genetic algorithm as well as the optimization of its hyperparameter.

\section{Research Questions}
\subsection{Research Question 1}
\textit{Is a genetic algorithm suitable for generating critical driving scenarios compared to a random generation?}

\subsection{Research Question 2}
\textit{Is it possible to improve the performance of a genetic algorithm using the taguchi method?}
