\section{Start Scenario}

\section{Population}
\label{chap:hyperparameter_tuning:population}
The number of Individuals is of high importance to a genetic algorithm, as has been explained in section \ref{chap:foundation:genetic_algorithm}. Especially considering the limed processing resources available, a suitable population size has to be found. On one hand, a population that is too low might result in less diverse runs of the genetic algorithm, on the other hand, if population is too high, the simulations will become too costly. Considering these points, the first step of the hyper parameter tuning was to find a suitable population size. In the next chapter \ref{chap:hyperparameter_tuning:other_parameter}, we will aim to improve the hyperparamter using a more robust approach.

In order to test for the best population size, the other hyperparameters have to be assumed using an educated guess. While reviewing the literature, trends of general settings for genetic algorithms can be found. However \cite{mills_determining_2015} highlight the inconsistencies between findings, stating to have "uncovered conflicting opinions and evidence regarding key GA control parameters". 

However \cite{grefenstette_optimization_1986} suggests, that "while it is possible to optimize GA control parameters, very good performance can be obtained with a range of GA control parameter settings." 
This is also complimented by findings from \cite{kacprzyk_parameter_2007}: "The key insight from such studies is the robustness of EAs with respect to their parameter settings. Getting “in the ball park” is generally sufficient for good EA performance. Stated another way, the EA parameter “sweet spot” is reasonably large and easy to find [18]. As a consequence most EAs today come with a default set of static parameter values that have been found to be quite robust in practice."

Chosing the right selection method is complicated as well, as discuees by \cite{kacprzyk_parameter_2007}:
"One source of difficulty here is that selection pressure is not as easy to “parameterize” as population size. We have a number of families of selection procedures (e.g, tournament selection, truncation selection, fitness-proportional selection, etc.) to choose from and a considerable body of literature analyzing their differences (see, for example, [19] or [15]), but deciding which family to choose or even which member of a parameterized family is still quite difficult, particularly because of the interacting effects with population size [13]."

Looking at the literature might lead to hyperparameters are used that at least sufficient enough, to get an idea which range for population size is suitable. We will now look at different concrete hyperparameter suggestions from the literature.

\subsection{Suggested hyperparameter from the literature}
\todo{Use best values also from : Using genetic algorithms for automating automated lane-keeping system testing}
\todo{Talk about rules (e.g. 1/n for mut rate...) - look at: Parameter selection in genetic algorithms}
In an often cited thesis by \cite{de_jong_analysis_1975}, the following parameters have been suggested:
GA(50, 0.6, 0.001, 1.0, 7, E) These suggested parameters have been used successfully by various different genetic algorithms \cite{grefenstette_optimization_1986}. 

An extensive study by \cite{mills_determining_2015} which that took over "over 60 numerical optimization problems." into consideration found that "the most effective level settings found for each factor: population size = 200, selection method = SUS, elite selection percentage = 8\%, reboot proportion = 0.4, number of crossover points = 3, mutation rate = adaptive and precision scaling = 1/2 as fine as specified by the user."

\cite{grefenstette_optimization_1986} claim that GA(30, 0.95, 0.01, 1.0, 1, E) and GA(80, 0.45, 0.01, 0.9, 1, P) produced the best results. They also advised against, a mutation rate of over 0.05, suggesting poor performance. Using a low mutation rate is also suggested by \cite{whitley_genetic_1994} and \cite{jinghui_zhong_comparison_2005}. 
On the other hand, \cite{boyabatli_parameter_2004} state, that "Controversial to existing literature on GA, our computational results reveal that in the case of a dominant set of decision variable the crossover operator does not have a significant impact on the performance measures, whereas high mutation rates are more suitable for GA applications."
Other paper also find a relatively high mutation rate useful. \cite{almanee_scenorita_2021} uses genetic algorithms in a similar domain as this thesis. There, a Population of 50, crossover of 0.8 and mut of 0.2 was used. These used params are the same as the default params from deap (pop = 50 CXPB, MUTPB, NGEN = 0.5, 0.2, 4). \todo{cite https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/overview.html}

\cite{srinivas_genetic_1994} state, that for a higher population, cross : 0.6, mut: 0.001 and pop: 100 is a good starting point, while a lower population needs higher crossover and mutation rates like this cross: 0.9, mut: 0.01, pop: 30


\cite{fazal_estimating_2005} recommends a population size of 50, a scattered crossover function with a crossover probability of 0.5. The used selection function was tournament selection. Elite count was set to 5.

\cite{dao_maximising_2016} suggests a population size of 200, two point crossover with a crossover probability of 0.7. A Gausian Mutation Function as well as roulette selection and elite count set to 1.

A population size of 200 and roulette selection is used by \cite{assistant_professor_amity_university_jaipur_rajasthan_india_parameter_2019}. Further, the elite count is set to10. A heuristic crossover function with a crossover probability of 0.4 is also used.

\subsection{results}
This now leads to a difficult decision in choosing the right parameters. Based on the extensive research, we will compare population size of 32, 48, 64 and 96. We will compare the different crossover rates: 0.8 and 0.6. For mutation, 0.01 and 0.2 will be discussed. Further we will use tournament selection with 2 and 4.
Each run will be executed 5 times to get rid of randomness and to make the results more robuts. We will run each simulation for 40 Generations.

In figure \ref{figure:population:results}, the results per population are plotted. The line is corresponds to the mean, while the bars show the spread (min to max) of all 5 repetitions.

\end{figure}


A high spread can be seen when looking at small population sizes. Considering these findings, a population size of 96 was chosen. While such a high value will result in a performance impact, it is important to keep the variation low.


\section{Design of Experiment}
\label{chap:hyperparameter_tuning:other_parameter}

Following the conclusion from the previous section \ref{chap:hyperparameter_tuning:population}, a population size of 96 will be used. Executing one run for 30 generations currently takes around 3:50 hours. Although two different workstations were available, the time required to execute the needed number of runs for these automated tests would exceed the available time budged. This is without considering a minimum required number of repetitions to remove randomness in the results.

In order to tune the hyperparameter of the genetic algorithm, various different strategies can be used. Using automated hyperparamter tuning approaches like "Grid Search", "Bayesian Optimization, "Simmulated Annealing or "Hyperband" might lead to good results with minimal effort (tuning hyperparameter of these search algorithms is still needed), however they require a high number of runs, which is not feasable.\todo{find references} 

A different approach called "design of experiment" (DOE), also known as statistically designed experiments. DOE tries to find the causeand-effect relationship between the factors and the output of experiments.
It uses factorial design where each experiment has factors, of which each consists of at least two settings, with the actual number of settings being called "levels" (\cite{yang_design_2009}). Design of experiment needs manual expertise to define which factors are possibly of importance and which settings each factor should have, this is a drawback compared to automatic hyperparameter tuning.

\enquote{If the range of variable is too small, then we may miss lots of useful information. If the range is too large, then the extreme values might give infeasible experimental runs.} (\cite{yang_design_2009})

Afterwards, main effects and interactions can be calculated to find the best settings per factor. It provides a graphical representation of these relationship by using interaction as well as main-effects charts.
Using ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) it is possible to identify the significance of each factor and interaction, which enables the ranking of these factors. More details on these analysis tools will be provided in section \ref{chap:hyperparameter_tuning:analysis_of_results}.

A full factorial design will test over all possible combinations of the manually selected factor levels. Looking at the proposed factors in table \ref{table:hyperparameter_tuning:settings_to_level}, we would require 1024 runs \todo{generated by minitab (or https://datatab.net/statistics-calculator/design-of-experiments)}, which not not feasible performance wise. A full factorial design has the drawback, that as the number if factors k gets increased, the number of needed experimental runs increases exponentially, thus resulting in lengthy experiments. \cite{yang_design_2009} state, that most of the results obtained by testing over all combinations are only used for estimating higher-order interactions, which are in most cases insignificant.

\enquote{Techniques such as fractional (or partial) factorial experiments are used to simplify the experiment. Fractional factorial experiments investigate only a fraction of all possible combinations. This approach saves considerable time and money but requires rigorous mathematical treatment, both in the design of the experiment and in the analysis of the results. (\cite{roy_primer_1990})}


\subsection{Taguchi Design}
Various improvements to Design of experiment have been but forward by Dr. Genichi Taguchi, such as reducing the influence of uncontrollable (noise) factors on processes and products and reducing variability. Some of these methods evolve around Signal-to-noise (S/N) analysis and utilizing cost functions to "express predicted improvements from DOE results in terms of expected cost saving" (\cite{roy_primer_1990}). This master thesis will not discuss all of Taguchi's proposed considerations, for more detail \cite{roy_primer_1990} as well as \cite{yang_design_2009} is highly recommended.

Using a Taguchi design for evaluating the best hyperparamter has been successfully performed by \cite{dao_maximising_2016} as well as \cite{assistant_professor_amity_university_jaipur_rajasthan_india_parameter_2019}. 

\enquote{ There are many similarities between “regular” experimental design and Taguchi's experimental design. However, in a Taguchi experiment, only the main effects and two-factor interactions are considered. Higher-order interactions are assumed to be nonexistent. In addition, experimenters are asked to identify which interactions might be significant before conducting the experiment, through their knowledge of the subject matter.} (\cite{yang_design_2009})

This masters thesis will mainly utilizes Taguchis orthogonal arrays (OAs), "which represent the smallest fractional factorials and are used for most common experiment designs." (\cite{roy_primer_1990}). This means, that only a fraction of combinations needs to be tested which drastically improves performance. Each row of these matrices contains the factors of one experiment, while the columns correspond the factors \cite{li_taguchi_2021}. 

Different orthogonal arrays have been proposed by Taguchi. The researcher has the responsibility to select an array based on the individual needs (\cite{li_taguchi_2021}).
Using these orthogonal arrays instead of full factorial experiments will lead to needing a much smaller amount of simulation runs (in our case only 16 compared to 1024), while the latter "might not provide appreciably more useful information" \cite{roy_primer_1990}.


An orthogonal array has multiple properties:
\todo{Definition orthogonal array}



As has been stated, probably the biggest drawback of using Taguchi orthogonal arrays is on the one hand to increased manual labour and on the other hand the fact, that higher order interactions ignored.

\cite{roy_primer_1990} explains why this might not be a big problem:
\enquote{Generally speaking, OA experiments work well when there is minimal interaction among factors; that is, the factor influences on the measured quality objectives are independent of each other and are linear. In other words, when the outcome is directly proportional to the linear combination of individual factor main effects, OA design identifies the optimum condition and estimates performance at this condition accurately. If, however, the factors interact with each other and influence the outcome, there is still a good chance that the optimum condition will be identified accurately, but the estimate of performance at the optimum can be significantly off. The degree of inaccuracy in performance estimates will depend on the degree of complexity of interactions among all the factors.}

This is complimented by \cite{yang_design_2009}, who states, that:
\enquote{During many years of applications of factorial design, people have found that higher-order interaction effects (i.e., interaction effects involving three or more factors) are very seldom significant. In most experimental case studies, only some main effects and two-factor interactions are significant.}

\paragraph{Selection of orthogonal array}
When choosing a suitable Taguchi orthogonal array, we need to take various factors into account, which can make the process tricky. According to \cite{yang_design_2009}, we will have to follow a three step procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Calculate the total degree of freedom (DOF). 
	\item Following two rules, standard orthogonal array should be selected:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Total DOF need to be smaller than the number of runs provided by the orthogonal array.
		\item All required factor level combinations need to be accommodated by the orthogonal array.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Factors have to be assigned using these rules: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item In case the factor level does not fit into the orthogonal array, methods such as column merging and dummy level can be used to modify the original array.
		\item Using the linear graph and interaction table, interactions can be defined. 
		\item In case some columns are not assigned, its possible to keep these columns empty.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


For this genetic algorithm, 7 factors (3 Factors of Level 4 and 4 Factors of Level 2) have been selected. Which factors to choose and with which level was done based on experience gained on section \ref{chap:hyperparameter_tuning:population}. When selecting levels, it is important to have them "as far away from either side of the current working condition as possible."(\cite{roy_primer_1990})
In table \ref{table:hyperparameter_tuning:settings_to_level}, every factor with corresponding levels has been listed,

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
\begin{tabular}{ |l|c||c|c|c|c|  }
	\hline
	Factors & Code & Level 1 & Level 2 & Level 3 & Level 4\\
	\hline
	CrossoverType 		& A & one point & two point & uniform 0.1 & uniform 0.5\\
	CrossoverProp    	& B & 0.2 & 0.5 & 0.8 & 0.9\\

	\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table:hyperparameter_tuning:settings_to_level}
\caption{List of Hyperparamters (Factors) matched to a Code and defined settings (Levels)}
\end{figure}


Using this table, we will now find the best standard orthogonal array in section \ref{chap:hyperparameter_tuning:selection_orthogonal_array}. Before doing so, it is important to state, that Taguchi allows to test for possible (pre determined) two-level interactions (\cite{yang_design_2009}). Analysing interactions comes at a cost of Degrees of freedom. If we look at the table, an interaction between ChromosomeType and GeneType might be of interest. Using the power of hindsight, we know, that a second two factor interaction is possible within our chosen array, thus we will have a look at the interaction between Tournament Size and IndMutationPropability as well.


\subsection{Selection of a suitable standart orthogonal array}
\label{chap:hyperparameter_tuning:selection_orthogonal_array}
The total degree of freedom can be quickly calculated using the rules provided by \cite{yang_design_2009}:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item 1 DOF is always used for the overall mean. 
	\item Each factor has a DOF of NumberOfLevels - 1.
	\item Two-factor interactions use this equation to calculate DOF: $(n_{factor1} - 1)(n_{factor2} - 1)$ where $n$ = number of levels.
\end{enumerate}


This leads to the following calculation for the needed 3 Factors of Level 4 and 4 Factors of Level 2 as well as the two interactions between ChromosomeType-GeneType and TournamentSize-IndMutationProp:

\begin{equation} \label{DOF}
	\begin{split}
		DOF & = 1 + 3 * (3 - 1) + 4 * (2 - 1) + 2 * (2 - 1) * (2 - 1) \\
		& = 13
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

A $L_{16}$ array seems suitable to accommodate the required 13 DOF, which can be seen in \ref{table:hyperparameter_tuning:L16_orhtogonal_array}.

This graph now needs to be fitted and modified to accommodate the needed factors. 4 Level Factors need additional space which will be generated using column merging, while interactions will need to be assigned as well.
For this, either an interaction table or linear graphs of the $L_{16}$ array can be used (\cite{nazandanacioglu_taguchi_2005}). 
The linear graph approach is straight forward and will be selected. While there are multiple linear graphs for $L_{16}$ array, \ref{figure:hyperparameter_tuning:linear_graph} describes the graph which best fits the requirements from table \ref{table:hyperparameter_tuning:settings_to_level}. If no graph with the perfect fit is found, theses graphs can be modified as well, using rules described by \cite{nazandanacioglu_taguchi_2005}.

"In each of Taguchi’s orthogonal arrays, there are one or more accompanying linear graphs. A linear graph is used to illustrate the interaction relationships in the orthogonal array."\cite{yang_design_2009}

In a Taguchi linear graph, the nodes as well as the ?Lines? both represent collumns in the orthogonal array. An interaction between to columns that are represented as nodes "comes out to" to the connecting line column \cite{taguchi_taguchis_2005}. This is useful for both analysing interactions between columns as well as combining (merging) interacting columns in case a higher factor is needed.

\paragraph{Column Merging}
A, B and C are both 4 level factors. The currently selected orthogonal only fits 2 level factors. Using column merging, it is possible to extend columns to accomodate higher order levels. 

As calculated in \ref{DOF}, a four-level column requires three degrees of freedom, thus three two-level columns need to be merged. For column merging, it is required, that the to be merged columns are part of an interaction group (\cite{yang_design_2009}).

So, 3 interaction 2-level columns need to first be selected. One column is discarded, the remain two columns need to be merged using the rules in tabular \ref{table:hyperparameter_tuning:merging_rules}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{ |ccccccc|  }
		\hline
		\multicolumn{3}{|c}{ OLD COLUMN } & & & & NEW COLUMN \\
		\hline
		& 1 & 1 & & -> & & 1\\
		& 1 & 2 & & -> & & 2\\
		& 2 & 1 & & -> & & 3\\
		& 2 & 2 & & -> & & 4\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Rules taken from \cite{roy_primer_1990}}
	\label{table:hyperparameter_tuning:merging_rules}
\end{figure}

The four-level factor can then be assigned to this newly generated column. Because three four-level factors are needed for the current experiment, nine two-level columns need to be merged in total.

\paragraph{Assigning Interactions}
Interactions between two-level factors can be assigned using the linear graph as well. Here, select two connected nodes. The column describing their connection will subsequently contain the interaction (\cite{taguchi_taguchis_2005}).

An interaction between ChromosomeType and GeneType seems possible, thus D and E will be assigned to connected nodes in the linear graph. As we still have some unused space in the graph, we will also look at the interaction of TournamentSize and IndMutationProp (F and G). The resulting graph can be seen in \ref{figure:hyperparameter_tuning:linear_graph_assigned}.

\subsection{Analysing the results}
\label{chap:hyperparameter_tuning:analysis_of_results}
Table \ref{table:hyperparameter_tuning:final_taguchi} can now can be used for running all the needed testcases (the interaction columns can be ignored until the evaluation). Transcoding all factors and levels to get the corresponding setting can be done using in the table from \ref{table:hyperparameter_tuning:settings_to_level}. We will repeat every setting 8 times to reduce randomness and gain information about variance. 
Running the Genetic Algorithm using these 16 different settings each repeated 8 times took 10 days on the two previously described workstations\todo{ref to section}.

The results are found in the appendix at \ref{table:appendix:hyperparameter_tuning:final_taguchi}.

\subsubsection{Main-effects and interaction chart}
Identifying the optimal conditions is done by analyzing the main effects per factor. Using them, it is possible to predict the factors, that lead to the best result \cite{roy_primer_1990}.

\cite{yang_design_2009} explains them well: 
\enquote{The main-effects chart is a plot of average responses at different levels of a factor versus the factor levels}

So, for every factor, sum up the mean of all results per level, then divide by the number of runs per level.

\todo{Example for D}

The resulting main-effect charts can be seen here:
\begin{figure}[H] 
	\label{figure:taguchi:main_effects}
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{simulations/taguchi/plots/main_effects}
	\caption{Main Effects}
\end{figure}


In case there is no interaction, the optimal setting is easily determined by using the main effects chart. Go over every factor in the chart and use the best level (in case of this experiment, the level with the lowest cost value). If interactions exist, they might have an influence on the best settings and need to be investigated (\cite{yang_design_2009}).

To investigate previously defined interactions, a test of interactions can be used. Their calculation is similar to calculating main effects.

\todo{Example for DE}

\begin{figure}[H] 
	\label{figure:taguchi:test_of_interaction}
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{simulations/taguchi/plots/test_of_interaction}
	\caption{Test of interactions}
\end{figure}

If lines cross, an interaction between the two factors exists. The more parallel the lines are, the less likely an interaction. Magnitude of the angle between the lines corresponds to the degree of interaction presence, according to \cite{roy_primer_1990}.

\subsubsection{ANOVA}
Before choosing the best settings, ANOVA analysis (analysis of variance) should be performend on the results. Among other things, this will provide information on the magnitude of contribution of each main effects and interactions. The calculation of ANOVA is the same as for a classical design of experiment, according to \cite{yang_design_2009}.

\todo{Summary after reading "Introduction into R"}

"In analysis of variance, mean squares are used in the F test to see if the corresponding effect is statistically significant."\cite{yang_design_2009}
"F ratio is a better measure for relative performance"\cite{yang_design_2009}

". The most commonly used criterion is to compare the p value with 0.05, or 5\%, if p value is less than 0.05, then that effect is significant."\cite{yang_design_2009}

"The variance ratio, commonly called the F statistic, is the ratio of variance due to the effect of a factor and variance due to the error term. (The F statistic is named after Sir Ronald A. Fisher.) This ratio is used to measure the significance of the factor under investigation with respect to the variance of all of the factors included in the error term. The F value obtained in the analysis is compared with a value from standard F-tables for a given statistical level of significance." \cite{roy_primer_1990}.


Due to our number of repetitions, the number of DOF increases according to the following equation (taken from \cite{roy_primer_1990}):
\begin{equation} \label{full DOF}
	\begin{split}
		DOF & = totalNumberOfResults - 1 \\
		& = numberOfTrials * numberOfRepetitions - 1 \\
		& = 16 * 8 - 1 = 127
	\end{split}
\end{equation}


Calculating ANOVA can be done using R:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
	# pivot the results, so that the table has 8 times the rows
	taguchi.combined_pivoted <- taguchi.combined %>% pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("min_"), values_to = "results")
	
	# run anova analysis
	anova <- aov(results ~ factor(A) + factor(B) + factor(C) + factor(D) * factor(E) + factor(F) * factor(G), data = taguchi.combined_pivoted)
	summary(anova)
\end{lstlisting}

This will result in the following table:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{ |cccccc|  }
		\hline
		Column 		& DF & Sum Sq & Mean Sq & F value & p value\\
		\hline
		1  & A 		& 3 & 1000 & 1000 & 1000\\
		2  & B 		& 3 & 1000 & 1000 & 1000\\
		3  & C 		& 3 & 1000 & 1000 & 1000\\
		4  & D 		& 1 & 1000 & 1000 & 1000\\
		5  & E 		& 1 & 1000 & 1000 & 1000\\
		6  & F 		& 1 & 1000 & 1000 & 1000\\
		7  & G 		& 1 & 1000 & 1000 & 1000\\
		8  & DxE 	& 1 & 1000 & 1000 & 1000\\
		9  & FxG 	& 1 & 1000 & 1000 & 1000\\
		\hline
		\multicolumn{2}{|c}{Residuals} &  & 1000 & 1000 & 1000\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{ANOVA results}
\end{figure}



We can also look at the percentage contribution of each factor, using the formula gathered by \cite{yang_design_2009}:

\begin{equation} \label{SS_T}
	\begin{split}
		SS_T & = SS_A + SS_B + SS_C + ... + SS_{error}
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{SS_T}
	\begin{split}
		contribution_A = SS_A / SS_T * 100
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

The percentage contribution is plotted in \ref{figure:taguchi:percentage_contribution}
\begin{figure}[H] 
	\label{figure:taguchi:percentage_contribution}
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{simulations/taguchi/plots/percentage_contribution}
	\caption{Percentage Contribution}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Selection of optimal setting}


"Further analysis for the significance of this influence is made possible by the ANOVA table in Table 5-16(b), which shows that the interaction A × C (column 3) is 5.26\%, compared to the individual main effects of butter (B) 64.76\% and flour (D) 18.4\%, and so on."\cite{roy_primer_1990}.

"To reexamine the optimum condition determined only from the factors A2, C1, B2, D1, and E1, we see from Figure 5-6 that AC 11has a higher value than AC 21. Thus, based on the interaction analysis, the optimum condition must include levels A1 and C1. The new optimum conditions become A1 B2 C1 D1 E1. However, the performance at the new optimum should be compared with the original optimum before the final determination of the interaction effects."\cite{roy_primer_1990}.
This means, that If an interaction exist, we
1. look at the best main effect combination
2. check if the interactions align with this combination -> look at Test of interactions
3. if not, combute $Y_{opt}$... -> look at page 88 from \cite{roy_primer_1990}. You use the interaction effects only for combuting Yopt (altough it is also possible to calc it without...)

"For the purpose of analysis, interactions are treated as any other factors; however, their presence is ignored for the preliminary determination of the optimum condition. The relative significance of interactions is obtained from an ANOVA study."\cite{roy_primer_1990}


"The performance at the optimum condition is estimated only from the significant factors. This practice keeps the predicted performance conservative. Therefore, the pooled factors are not included in the estimate."\cite{roy_primer_1990}


If we only look at main effects, we would select:
A4, B4, C3, D2, E2, F2, G1
However we select A4, B4, C3, D2, E1, F2, G1 because of important interaction DE. E on the other hand is not significant.


\paragraph{Optimum performance calculation}
We can also optimum performance when 1. using only main effects or 2. using main effects with applied interaction. Folrumar provided by \cite{roy_primer_1990}.

\todo{Better bars}
\begin{equation} \label{optimum_perf_main_effect}
	\begin{split}
		Y_{opt} &= \bar{T} + (\bar{A_4} - \bar{T}) + (\bar{B_4} - \bar{T}) + (\bar{C_3} - \bar{T}) + (\bar{D_2} - \bar{T}) + (\bar{E_2} - \bar{T})  + (\bar{F_2} - \bar{T}) + (\bar{G_1} - \bar{T}) \\
			&= 2693.984
	\end{split}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation} \label{optimum_perf_included_interaction}
	\begin{split}
		Y_{opt} &= \bar{T} + (\bar{A_4} - \bar{T}) + (\bar{B_4} - \bar{T}) + (\bar{C_3} - \bar{T}) + (\bar{D_2} - \bar{T}) + (\bar{E_1} - \bar{T})  + ([\bar{DxE}]_2 - \bar{T})  + (\bar{F_2} - \bar{T}) + (\bar{G_1} - \bar{T}) \\
		&= 2686.547
	\end{split}
\end{equation}








SN -> proposed by taguchi. "A common approach to analyze such results is to use the average of the trial results for the optimum condition. Unfortunately, average alone does not capture complete information about the variability present."\cite{roy_primer_1990}

"Repetition permits determination of a variance index called the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. The greater this value, the smaller the product variance around the target value"\cite{roy_primer_1990}

TODO: Somehow argument, that having less variablity is only to an extend important. It is always possible to restart a simulation, if the variability is not too large, it is important that the results have a good mean overall. Less variability is in producing products much more important.


"Advantage of S/N Ratio Over Average To analyze the results of experiments involving multiple runs, use of the S/N ratio over standard analysis (use average of results) is preferred. Analysis using the S/N ratio will offer the following advantages: 1. It provides a guidance to selection of the optimum level based on the least variation around the target and also on the average value closest to the target. 2. It offers objective comparison of two sets of experimental data with respect to variation around the target and the deviation of the average from the target value. Because S/N represents results transformed into a logarithmic scale that linearizes any nonlinear behavior, if present, the assumption of linearity for prediction of optimum performance is validated."\cite{roy_primer_1990}


"On the other hand, for set A, the spread around its average is smaller, but the average itself is quite far from the target. Which one of the two is better? Based on average value, the product shown by observation B appears to be better. Based on consistency, product A is better. How can one credit A for less variation? How does one compare the distances of the averages from the target? Surely, comparing the averages is one method. Use of the S/N ratio offers an objective way to look at the two characteristics together."\cite{roy_primer_1990}



Not usefull for our purposes... Because df is reduced, run anova without interactions (or maybe without bad main effects). Fazit: S N was tried, however resulting anova showed that no factor was significant. Thus is was not further investigated.

"Effect of S/N Ratio on the Analysis Use of the S/N ratio of the results, instead of the average values, introduces some minor changes in the analysis. 
1. Degrees of freedom of the entire experiment is reduced. DOF with S/N ratio = number of trial conditions - 1 (that is, number of repetitions is reduced to 1). 
Recall that the DOF in the case of the standard analysis is: DOF = (number of trials × number of repetitions) - 1 The S/N ratio calculation is based on data from all observations of a trial condition. 
The set of S/N ratios can then be considered as trial results without repetitions.
Hence the DOF, in the case of S/N, is the number of trials - 1. 
The rest of the analysis follows the standard procedure."\cite{roy_primer_1990}
