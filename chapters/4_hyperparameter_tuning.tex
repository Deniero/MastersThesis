\section{Start Scenario}

\section{Population}
\label{chap:hyperparameter_tuning:population}
The number of Individuals is of high importance to a genetic algorithm, as has been explained in section \ref{chap:foundation:genetic_algorithm}. Especially considering the limed processing resources available, a suitable population size has to be found. On one hand, a population that is too low might result in less diverse runs of the genetic algorithm, on the other hand, if population is too high, the simulations will become too costly. Considering these points, the first step of the hyper parameter tuning was to find a suitable population size. In the next chapter \ref{chap:hyperparameter_tuning:other_parameter}, we will aim to improve the hyperparamter using a more robust approach.

In order to test for the best population size, the other hyperparameters have to be assumed using an educated guess. While reviewing the literature, trends of general settings for genetic algorithms can be found. However \cite{mills_determining_2015} highlight the inconsistencies between findings, stating to have "uncovered conflicting opinions and evidence regarding key GA control parameters". 

However \cite{grefenstette_optimization_1986} suggests, that "while it is possible to optimize GA control parameters, very good performance can be obtained with a range of GA control parameter settings." 
This is also complimented by findings from \cite{kacprzyk_parameter_2007}: "The key insight from such studies is the robustness of EAs with respect to their parameter settings. Getting “in the ball park” is generally sufficient for good EA performance. Stated another way, the EA parameter “sweet spot” is reasonably large and easy to find [18]. As a consequence most EAs today come with a default set of static parameter values that have been found to be quite robust in practice."

Chosing the right selection method is complicated as well, as discuees by \cite{kacprzyk_parameter_2007}:
"One source of difficulty here is that selection pressure is not as easy to “parameterize” as population size. We have a number of families of selection procedures (e.g, tournament selection, truncation selection, fitness-proportional selection, etc.) to choose from and a considerable body of literature analyzing their differences (see, for example, [19] or [15]), but deciding which family to choose or even which member of a parameterized family is still quite difficult, particularly because of the interacting effects with population size [13]."

Looking at the literature might lead to hyperparameters are used that at least sufficient enough, to get an idea which range for population size is suitable. We will now look at different concrete hyperparameter suggestions from the literature.

\subsection{Suggested hyperparameter from the literature}
\todo{Use best values also from : Using genetic algorithms for automating automated lane-keeping system testing}
\todo{Talk about rules (e.g. 1/n for mut rate...) - look at: Parameter selection in genetic algorithms}
In an often cited thesis by \cite{de_jong_analysis_1975}, the following parameters have been suggested:
GA(50, 0.6, 0.001, 1.0, 7, E) These suggested parameters have been used successfully by various different genetic algorithms \cite{grefenstette_optimization_1986}. 

An extensive study by \cite{mills_determining_2015} which that took over "over 60 numerical optimization problems." into consideration found that "the most effective level settings found for each factor: population size = 200, selection method = SUS, elite selection percentage = 8\%, reboot proportion = 0.4, number of crossover points = 3, mutation rate = adaptive and precision scaling = 1/2 as fine as specified by the user."

\cite{grefenstette_optimization_1986} claim that GA(30, 0.95, 0.01, 1.0, 1, E) and GA(80, 0.45, 0.01, 0.9, 1, P) produced the best results. They also advised against, a mutation rate of over 0.05, suggesting poor performance. Using a low mutation rate is also suggested by \cite{whitley_genetic_1994} and \cite{jinghui_zhong_comparison_2005}. 
On the other hand, \cite{boyabatli_parameter_2004} state, that "Controversial to existing literature on GA, our computational results reveal that in the case of a dominant set of decision variable the crossover operator does not have a significant impact on the performance measures, whereas high mutation rates are more suitable for GA applications."
Other paper also find a relatively high mutation rate useful. \cite{almanee_scenorita_2021} uses genetic algorithms in a similar domain as this thesis. There, a Population of 50, crossover of 0.8 and mut of 0.2 was used. These used params are the same as the default params from deap (pop = 50 CXPB, MUTPB, NGEN = 0.5, 0.2, 4). \todo{cite https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/overview.html}

\cite{srinivas_genetic_1994} state, that for a higher population, cross : 0.6, mut: 0.001 and pop: 100 is a good starting point, while a lower population needs higher crossover and mutation rates like this cross: 0.9, mut: 0.01, pop: 30

These next three paper use ANOVA analysis to come a conclusion. \cite{fazal_estimating_2005} recommend:
Migration direction: Forward
Population size: 50 
Fitness scaling function: Rank
Selection function: Tournament
Elite count: 5
Crossover fraction: 0.5
Crossover function: Scattered


\cite{dao_maximising_2016} suggests these values after anova:
Migdirection: forwards
pop size: 200
fitness scaling: rank
selection: roulette
elite count: 1
Crossover prop: 0.7
MutationFunc: Gaussian
Crossover FUnc: two point
hybrid function: none


\cite{assistant_professor_amity_university_jaipur_rajasthan_india_parameter_2019} use these values after anova:
Direction: Forward
Pop: 200 
Fitness Scaling Function: linar Shift
selection: Roulette 
elite count: 10 
Crossover: 0.4 
Mutation: Constraint Dependent 
Crossover function: Heuristi
Hybrid Function: None




\subsection{results}
This now leads to a difficult decision in choosing the right parameters. Based on the extensive research, we will compare population size of 32, 48, 64 and 96. We will compare the different crossover rates: 0.8 and 0.6. For mutation, 0.01 and 0.2 will be discussed. Further we will use tournament selection with 2 and 4.
Each run will be executed 5 times to get rid of randomness and to make the results more robuts. We will run each simulation for 40 Generations.

In figure \ref{figure:population:results}, the results per population are plotted. The line is corresponds to the mean, while the bars show the spread (min to max) of all 5 repetitions.

\end{figure}


A high spread can be seen when looking at small population sizes. Considering these findings, a population size of 96 was chosen. While such a high value will result in a performance impact, it is important to keep the variation low.


\section{Design of Experiment}
\label{chap:hyperparameter_tuning:other_parameter}

In order to tune the hyperparameter of the genetic algorithm, various different strategies can be used. Using automated hyperparamter tuning approaches like "Grid Search", "Bayesian Optimization, "Simmulated Annealing or "Hyperband" might lead to good results with minimal effort (tuning hyperparameter of these search algorithms is still needed), however they require a high number of runs, which is not feasable.\todo{find references} 

Following the conclusion from the previous section \ref{chap:hyperparameter_tuning:population}, a population size of 96 will be used. Executing one run for 30 generations currently takes around 3:50 hours. Although two different workstations were available, the time required to execute the needed number of runs for these automated tests would exceed the available time budged. This is without considering a minimum required number of repetitions to remove randomness in the results.

A different approach called "design of experiment" (DOE), also known as factorial design (\cite{roy_primer_1990}). Each design of experiment has factors, of which each consists of at least two settings, with the actual number of settings being called "levels" (\cite{yang_design_2009}). Design of experiment needs manual expertise to define which factors are possibly of importance and which settings each factor should have, this is a drawback compared to automatic hyperparameter tuning. Afterwards, main effects and interactions can be calculated to find the best settings per factor. Using ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) it is possible to identify the significance of each main effect and interaction. More details on these analysis tools will be provided in section \ref{chap:hyperparameter_tuning:analysis_of_results}.

In a factorial designs, each possible combination of factor levels needs to be tested. Looking at the proposed factors in table \ref{table:hyperparameter_tuning:settings_to_level}, we would require 1024 runs \todo{generated by minitab (or https://datatab.net/statistics-calculator/design-of-experiments)}.

"Techniques such as fractional (or partial) factorial experiments are used to simplify the experiment. Fractional factorial experiments investigate only a fraction of all possible combinations. This approach saves considerable time and money but requires rigorous mathematical treatment, both in the design of the experiment and in the analysis of the results." \cite{roy_primer_1990} \todo{Is this really the case? What about combinatorial testing? }


\subsection{Taguchi Design}
Various improvements to Design of experiment have been but forward by Dr. Genichi Taguchi, such as reducing the influence of uncontrollable (noise) factors on processes and products and reducing variability. Some of these methods evolve around Signal-to-noise (S/N) analysis and utilizing cost functions to "express predicted improvements from DOE results in terms of expected cost saving" (\cite{roy_primer_1990}). This master thesis will not discuss all of this proposed considerations, for more detail \cite{roy_primer_1990} as well as \cite{yang_design_2009} is highly recommended.

This masters thesis will mainly utilizes Taguchis orthogonal arrays (OAs), "which represent the smallest fractional factorials and are used for most common experiment designs." (\cite{roy_primer_1990}).
Taguchis proposed various different orthogonal arrays which need to be selected based on the individual needs. Each row of these arrays stands for 1 trial condition (i.e factor level combination of individual experiment), while the columns represent the factors.

\todo{Definition orthogonal array}

Using these orthogonal arrays instead of full factorial experiments will lead to needing a much smaller amount of simulation runs (in our case only 16 compared to 1024), while the latter "might not provide appreciably more useful information" \cite{roy_primer_1990}.


\todo{cons of taguchi arrays: no higher level interactions}

When choosing a suitable taguchi ortogonal arrays, we need to take various factors into account, which can make the process tricky. According to \cite{yang_design_2009}, we will have to follow a three step procedure:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Calculate the total degree of freedom (DOF). 
	\item Following two rules, standard orthogonal array should be selected:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Total DOF need to be smaller than the number of runs provided by the orthogonal array.
		\item All required factor level combinations need to be accommodated by the orthogonal array.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item Factors have to be assigned using these rules: 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item In case the factor level does not fit into the orthogonal array, methods such as column merging and dummy level can be used to modify the original array.
		\item Using the linear graph and interaction table, interactions can be defined. 
		\item In case some columns are not assigned, its possible to keep these columns empty.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


For this genetic algorithm, 7 factors (3 Factors of Level 4 and 4 Factors of Level 2) have been selected. Which factors to choose and with which level was done based on experience gained on section \ref{chap:hyperparameter_tuning:population}. In table \ref{table:hyperparameter_tuning:settings_to_level}, every factor with correspondig levels has been listed,

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
\begin{tabular}{ |l|c||c|c|c|c|  }
	\hline
	Factors & Code & Level 1 & Level 2 & Level 3 & Level 4\\
	\hline
	CrossoverType 		& A & one point & two point & uniform 0.1 & uniform 0.5\\
	CrossoverProp    	& B & 0.2 & 0.5 & 0.8 & 0.9\\
	MutationProp   		& C & 0.01 & 0.1 & 0.3 & 0.5\\
	ChromosomeType   	& D & Time & Time+NPC & - & -\\
	GeneType			& E & int & dict & - & -\\

	\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table:hyperparameter_tuning:settings_to_level}
\caption{List of Hyperparamters (Factors) matched to a Code and defined settings (Levels)}
\end{figure}


Using this table, we will now find the best standart orthogonal array in section \ref{chap:hyperparameter_tuning:selection_orthogonal_array}. Before doing so, it is important to state, that taguchi allows to test for possible (pre determined) two-level interactions (\cite{yang_design_2009}). Analysing interactions comes at a cost of Degrees of freedom. If we look at the table, an interaction between ChromosomeType and GeneType might be of interest. Using the power of hindsight, we know, that a second two factor interaction is possible within our chosen array, thus we will have a look at the interaction between Tournament Size and IndMutationPropability.


\subsection{Selection of a suitable standart orthogonal array}
\label{chap:hyperparameter_tuning:selection_orthogonal_array}
The total degree of freedom can be quickly calculated using the rules provided by \cite{yang_design_2009}:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item 1 DOF is always used for the overall mean. 
	\item Each factor has a DOF of NumberOfLevels - 1.
	\item Two-factor interactions use this equation to calculate DOF: $(n_{factor1} - 1)(n_{factor2} - 1)$ where $n$ = number of levels.
\end{enumerate}


This leads to the following calculation for the needed 3 Factors of Level 4 and 4 Factors of Level 2 as well as the two interactions between ChromosomeType-GeneType and TournamentSize-IndMutationProp:

\begin{equation} \label{DOF}
	\begin{split}
		DOF & = 1 + 3 * (3 - 1) + 4 * (2 - 1) + 2 * (2 - 1) * (2 - 1) \\
		& = 13
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

A $L_{16}$ array seems suitable to accommodate the required 13 DOF, which can be seen in \ref{table:hyperparameter_tuning:L16_orhtogonal_array}.

This graph now needs to be fitted to the needed factors. 4 Level Factors need more space which will be generated using column merging, while interactions need to be assigned as well.
For this, either an interaction table or linear graphs of this $L_{16}$ array can be used (\cite{roy_primer_1990}, \cite{nazandanacioglu_taguchi_2005}). 
The linear graph approach is straight forward and will be selected. While there are multiple linear graphs for $L_{16}$ array, the following graph has the best fit for the requirements from table \ref{table:hyperparameter_tuning:settings_to_level}.

In a taguchi linear graph, the nodes as well as the ?Lines? both represent collumns in the orthogonal array. An interaction between to columns that are represented as nodes "comes out to" to the connecting line column \cite{taguchi_taguchis_2005}. This is usefull for both analyzing interactions between columns as well as combining (mergin) interacting columns in case a higher factor is needed.

Removing the old and inserting the new columns in the table and transcoding 7 to D, 9 to E, 14 to DE, 6 to F, 11 to G and 13 to FG results in the final table \ref{table:hyperparameter_tuning:final_taguchi}.
This A-G combinations table will subsequently be used as settings for simulations.

\subsection{Analysing the results}
\label{chap:hyperparameter_tuning:analysis_of_results}
This now can be used for running all the needed testcases (the interaction columns can be ignored until the evaluation). Simply exchange all levels in the table with the corresponding setting from table \ref{table:hyperparameter_tuning:settings_to_level}. We will repeat every setting 8 times. These are the results:

\subsubsection{ANOVA}

Due to our number of repetitions, the number of DOF increases according to the following equation (taken from \cite{roy_primer_1990}):

\begin{equation} \label{full DOF}
	\begin{split}
		DOF & = totalNumberOfResults - 1 \\
		& = numberOfTrials * numberOfRepetitions - 1 \\
		& = 16 * 8 - 1 = 127
	\end{split}
\end{equation}



Calculating ANOVA can be done using R: \todo{Cite book from Gabriel}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
	# pivot the results, so that the table has 8 times the rows
	taguchi.combined_pivoted <- taguchi.combined %>% pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("min_"), values_to = "results")

	# run anova analysis
	anova <- aov(results ~ factor(A) + factor(B) + factor(C) + factor(D) * factor(E) + factor(F) * factor(G), data = taguchi.combined_pivoted)
	summary(anova)
\end{lstlisting}

After pooling, we can run anova again:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
	anova <- aov(results ~ factor(A) + factor(B) + factor(C) + factor(D) * factor(E) + factor(F) * factor(G), data = taguchi.combined_pivoted)
	summary(anova)
\end{lstlisting}

This will result in the following table:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{ |cccccc|  }
		\hline
		Column 		& DF & Sum Sq & Mean Sq & F value & p value\\
		\hline
		1  & A 		& 3 & 1000 & 1000 & 1000\\
		2  & B 		& 3 & 1000 & 1000 & 1000\\

		\multicolumn{2}{|c}{Residuals} &  & 1000 & 1000 & 1000\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{ANOVA results}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Main-effects and interaction chart}\todo{Main-effects or main-effect}

According to \cite{yang_design_2009}, "The main-effects chart is a plot of average responses at different levels of a factor versus the factor levels" and the calculation" of main-effect charts and iteration charts are the same as those of classical experimental data analysis".

For every factor, sum up the mean of the results per level, then divide by the number of runs per level. This is the calculation for D:
\todo{Insert calculation for d}

The resulting main-effect charts can be seen here:
\begin{figure}[H] 
	\label{figure:taguchi:main_effects}
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{simulations/taguchi/plots/main_effects}
	\caption{Main Effects}
\end{figure}



Similarly, the interactions are calculated like this:
\todo{Insert example calculation of interaction}


The resulting interaction charts can be seen here:

	\label{figure:taguchi:interaction_effects}
	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{simulations/taguchi/plots/interaction_effects}
